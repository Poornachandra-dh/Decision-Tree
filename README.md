# Decision-Tree
🌳 Decision Tree Regression  Decision Tree Regression is a non-linear supervised learning algorithm that splits the data into smaller and smaller subsets based on feature values, forming a tree structure to make predictions.
Here's a clear and concise description you can use for your GitHub project on **Decision Tree Regression**:
